# Gomuku
gomuku.py was created together as a group project by Dav Vrat Chadha and Mehul Bhardwaj.
gomuku.py is a python implementation of the classic game gomuku. This is a PvC (player vs computer) game.
Upon running the file, the computer plays first. A board is displayed upon each move as ASCII-art.
gomuku.py also conatins a few game tests and an analysis function to check if the code works properly, but has been commented out.
To use the tests and anaysis feature, uncomment the tester code block in if __name__ == "__main__" function.
